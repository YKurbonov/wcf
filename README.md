There are two tools used to solve the assignment:
1) PostGRESQL.

postgre.txt file has instructions to import (graph) and transform (query) and export (graph) the data. summaryPsotGre.csv is a result.

2) Java

source has classes to read, transform, and write the data. summaryJava.csv is a result.

Thanks,
