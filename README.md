There are many ways to solve the assignment. 

Here are three solutions:


1) PostGRESQL. 
Tool used: PostgreSQL 13, pgAdmin 4

postgre.txt file has instructions to import (graph) and transform (query) and export (graph) the data. summaryPsotGre.csv is a result.


2) Java. 
Tool used: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

source has classes to read, transform, and write the data. summaryJava.csv is a result.

3) SQLite. 
Tool used: sqlite3

SQLite.txt file has instructions to read and transform and export the data. summarySQLite.csv is a result.



Thanks,
